[Link to your deployed Streamlit app]

## Overview

This project analyzes crime data using Python, focusing on trends over the years, common crime types, and the relationship between total crimes and crimes solved. The analysis is performed using the `pandas`, `altair`, `folium`, and `streamlit` libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

The Streamlit app provides interactive features for exploring crime trends, weapon types, gender-based crime distribution, and even a real-time city-wise crime data dashboard.

## Local Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Git

### Installation and Running the App Locally
1. Clone the repository:
